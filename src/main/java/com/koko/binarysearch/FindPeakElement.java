/**
 * 162. Find Peak Element
 * <p>
 * A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
 * <p>
 * Given an integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return
 * the index to any of the peaks.
 * <p>
 * You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž.
 * <p>
 * You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
 * <p>
 * Example 2:
 * Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the
 * peak element is 6.
