## Array
1. Find subarray with given sum (Non negative Numbers) [sliding window, preSum]
2. Find subarray with given sum (Negative Numbers) [preSum]
    -   Note  :- It can be done only using preSum not with sliding window
3. Subarray Sum Equals K - total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to k [preSum, frequency map]
4. Merge two sorted array without extra space
5. Rearrange Array Alternately in O(1) space
6. Sort an array of 0s, 1s and 2s

## String
1. Reverse words in a given string
2. Permutations of a given string

## Binary Tree
1. In order traversal - iteratively
2. Pre order traversal - iteratively (push before while loop)
3. Left/Right view
4. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
5. Balanced Binary Tree (left_height-right_height <=1)
6. Diameter of Binary Tree
7. Children sum parent
8. Root to leaf path - concept is important
    1. Path Sum
    2. Path Sum II

## Dynamic Programming
1. 0-1 knapsack
    1. Subset Sum
    2. Equal sum partition
    3. Count of subset sum
    4. Minimum subset sum difference
    5. Target Sum
    6. Hash of subset& given difference
2. Unbounded knapsack
