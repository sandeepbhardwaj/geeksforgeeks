## Array
1. Find subarray with given sum (Non negative Numbers) [sliding window, preSum]
2. Find subarray with given sum (Negative Numbers) [preSum]
    -   Note  :- It can be done only using preSum not with sliding window
3. Subarray Sum Equals K - total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to k [preSum, frequency map]
4. Merge two sorted array without extra space
5. Rearrange Array Alternately in O(1) space
6. Sort an array of 0s, 1s and 2s
7. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock [Kadane's Problem]

## Binary Search
1. Binary Search
2. Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array
3. Search in sorted rotated array
4. Search in sorted rotated array with duplicates
5. Find minimum in rotated sorted array

## Sliding Window
1. Max sum of 'k' consecutive elements in the array
2. Ist -ve number in every window of Size K

## String
1. Reverse words in a given string
2. Permutations of a given string

## Binary Tree
1. In order traversal - iteratively
2. Pre-order traversal - iteratively (push before while loop)
3. Level order traversal
4. Left/Right view
5. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
