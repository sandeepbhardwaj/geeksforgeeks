/**
 * <pre>
 * Selection sort is a in-place comparison-based algorithm in which the list is
 * divided into two parts, the sorted part at the left end and the unsorted part
 * at the right end. Initially, the sorted part is empty and the unsorted part
 * is the entire list.
 * 
 * Consider sorting n numbers stored in array A by first finding the smallest
 * element of A and exchanging it with the element in A(1). Then find the second
 * smallest element of A, and exchange it with A(2). Continue in this manner for
 * the first n-1 elements of A.
 * 
 * The good thing about selection sort is it never makes more than O(n) swaps
 * and can be useful when memory write is a costly operation.
 * 
 * 64 25 12 22 11 // this is the initial, starting state of the array
 * 
 * 11 25 12 22 64 // sorted sublist = {11}
 * 
 * 11 12 25 22 64 // sorted sublist = {11, 12}
 * 
 * 11 12 22 25 64 // sorted sublist = {11, 12, 22}
 * 
 * 11 12 22 25 64 // sorted sublist = {11, 12, 22, 25}
 * 
 * 11 12 22 25 64 // sorted sublist = {11, 12, 22, 25, 64}
 * 
 * worst case complexities are of ÎŸ(n2)
